# Productionization Agent State

This is the bounded operational recovery snapshot, not a chronological log. GitHub/current `main` is authoritative;
immutable detail remains in commits, pull requests, and workflow runs.

## Current control state

- `schema_version`: 2
- `last_reconciled_main_sha`: `d709f16b37e40837c4ee687a6bc03ab92ea55218`
- `last_reconciled_main_tree`: `73bba924315c1cf0421e0c9b6cb44a22fa3e940c`
- `roadmap_status`: no active roadmap PR; SIG-05 / PR #92 merged
- `current_pr_id`: none
- `current_phase`: none
- `last_completed_roadmap_pr`: `SIG-05` / PR #92 / merge
  `d709f16b37e40837c4ee687a6bc03ab92ea55218`
- `autonomy_mode`: disabled outside the explicit scope of an authorized PR
- `merge`: PR #92 merged at `d709f16b37e40837c4ee687a6bc03ab92ea55218`; implementation, review,
  and CI records remain in its GitHub conversation
- `next_dependency`: BT-01 remains unauthorized and requires separate user authorization
- SIG-04 validates caller-supplied candidates only; no inference
- SIG-05 adds only in-memory deterministic shadow envelopes; later roadmap work remains deferred
- SIG-05 authorizes no portfolio, risk, order, broker, PAPER/live, or promotion behavior; explicit human PAPER/live gates remain mandatory and unexercised

## SIG-03 recovery reference

PR #87 merged at `6de1635a90d6c33aee02079dca5d0932e3a32cec`; its original JIT base was
`49d5980b640638ed687b6c7771f5f28367072c9a`. Its complete RED/GREEN, review, CI, and repair history
remains recoverable in PR #87. SIG-03 owns deterministic `QuantSignal` only; it adds no portfolio,
risk, order, broker, PAPER/live, credential, deployment, or promotion behavior.

## SIG-02 recovery reference

PR #45 implemented the deterministic Evidence tools and `ResearchNote` boundary over sealed evidence.
The final reviewed source head was `de51698180ff6873c7512c70828add3c55728fb9`; its source tree was
`ef87b5e4c5b9778bbbcdde74d6db5b53b802865c`. The merge commit was
`376c9c044722ee37f3fa36691b576420e3b6253d` with resulting tree
`ef87b5e4c5b9778bbbcdde74d6db5b53b802865c`. No provider, network, ordinary-graph fallback, broker,
PAPER/live, or promotion behavior was introduced.

## Current harness policy

- `harness_reconciled_through`: PR #90 / merge `8f76f341bedf086dd4eb69e4229be33127f5028f`
- `active_harness_pr`: none
- PR #90 completed bounded pstack compatibility replay and preserves PR #88 model routing, PR #86
  read-only review assurance, and all PAPER/live gates.
- PR #88's policy merge `a42ce7a654994d8071824c3aaba4c9e5503a7e9d` remains recoverable in the
  completed Harness sequence below.
- PR #90's RED/GREEN, writer lease, exact-head review, and required-check evidence remain in its PR conversation.
- PR #91's JIT and lease lifecycle remain recoverable in its PR conversation; PR #92 subsequently completed SIG-05.
- PR #92's JIT, RED evidence, writer lease lifecycle, review, and CI remain recoverable in its GitHub
  conversation; it merged at `d709f16b37e40837c4ee687a6bc03ab92ea55218`.
- PR #86's read-only review-assurance policy remains active.

The completed Harness sequence is summarized by theme: #74–#77 covered state reconciliation, benchmark
integrity, network-denial proof, and safe review worktrees; #78–#81 covered degraded assurance, writer-lane
identity, hook manifests, and advisory stop diagnostics; #82–#84 covered Foundation CI deduplication,
runtime-neutral collaboration terminology, and instruction ownership/compaction; #85 completed final state
closeout.

- Former automatic-review ruleset `23141241`: observed disabled on 2026-09-19; main-protection required contexts
  remain authoritative.
- Post-#86 main-push CI `35486435734`: PASS; CodeQL `35486435740`: PASS.
- Historical post-SIG-02 checks: CI `35473160937`: PASS; CodeQL `35473160983`: PASS.

## Runtime limitations and watch-only features

- The host permission profile is disabled/unrestricted. Under the PR #86 policy, missing
  host-origin sandbox/approval/tool-inventory facts are supplemental disclosure and do not themselves block
  review.
- A separate controlling review context remains mandatory and uses a detached exact-head worktree with
  before/after SHA and cleanliness evidence; observed mutation, stale/dirty isolation, missing required
  roles, BLOCKER/HIGH findings, and required-CI failures remain blocking.
- Hook load/trust state is unknown and ineffective absent a host report.
- Runtime receipt, offline verifier, and checked-in config do not authenticate host/model/isolation.
- The writer lease is cooperative structural evidence and does not defend against same-user processes.
- Apps and Memories remain disabled by intent. Rules, Permission Profiles, OTel, and repo Plugins remain
  watch-only.
- External-spec official Docs MCP remains configuration intent unless observed at runtime.

The root instructions own the permanent external-agent prohibition. This state records operational facts only
and does not replace the root policy, audit protocol, required CI, exact-head review, or Master merge gate.
